# MrBeast-challenge

# In the MrBeast_Analysis.ipynb file, you will need to import the Pandas and Matplotlib dependencies to run the code.

# Commentary within the cells explains the purpose of each function.

# Successfully running the code displays the Excel files as Pandas DataFrames, then Matplotlib.pyplot charts that output a PDF file to the Resources folder.

# The original data from 'Video 1', 'Video 2', and 'Video 3' can be found as .xlsx files within the Resources folder.
